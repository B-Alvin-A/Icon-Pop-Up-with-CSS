# Icon-Pop-Up-with-CSS
This is a HTML and CSS code for creating a pop-up effect for icons using the Ionicons library. The pop-up effect is triggered when the user hovers over the circular base element. 
The code includes the following:

Three list items, each representing an icon (HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript).
CSS code for the layout, animation, and pop-up effect.
A script tag to import the Ionicons library.
The CSS code is responsible for the circular shape of the base element, the rotation animation, and the pop-up effect for the title and icon. The base element has a hover effect that triggers the pop-up effect by changing the position, color, and text shadow of the title and icon elements. The Ionicons library is used to display the respective icon for each list item.

Note: This code uses Google Fonts to import the "Poppins" and "Space Grotesk" fonts, and the Ionicons library to display the icons. Therefore, an internet connection is required to use this code.
